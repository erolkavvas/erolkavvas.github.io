* I was most recently a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher at [Envisagenics](https://www.envisagenics.com/), an RNA Therapeutics company. My work focused on functional genomics, where I developed AI models to predict the impact of RNA splicing on pathway and protein function.
* I recieved my PhD at UCSD in Bioengineering, advised by Bernhard Palsson at the [Systems Biology Research Group](https://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/). My [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/a7992517c1b25767e97e57a23dc7aa07/1?cbl=51922&diss=y&pq-origsite=gscholar) was on developing biologically-interpretable machine learning models for understanding drug resistance and microbial evolution. Following my PhD, I was post-doctoral researacher at the [Tagkopoulos Lab](http://tagkopouloslab.ucdavis.edu/) where I built models integrating machine learning and metabolic networks to predict diet from gut microbiome composition. 
* My research interests include explainable AI, systems biology, biological 'omics analysis, and evolutionary game theory.
* I'm a musician and currently play drums for [Dread Spire](https://open.spotify.com/artist/19sbutOT1IUBohowndpZTD?si=OYULTN-3SqqovcELIEjdug), a bay area sludge doom metal 2-piece. See the [Music](https://erolkavvas.github.io/music/) tab for links to music I've made.

What's New?
======
* I'm quit my job in February 2025 to take a break and figure out what I want to do. I plan on working again starting in the fall.
* My last project involved developing an interpretable LLM for predicting the functional impact of exon splicing on protein function (no links to project are available due to company NDA).
