## Experience

### Data Scientist, Envisagenics — New York City, NY  
**July 2022 – Feb 2025**
- Built & deployed **SplicePath**, an Azure ML pipeline modeling exon/transcript effects on pathway activity; adopted by oncology teams for 20+ drug targets.  
- Led network interpretation layer to explain transcript–pathway effects via molecular interaction graphs.  
- Designed a no‑code interface in Microsoft Fabric, boosting non‑technical adoption of SplicePath.  
- Developed **SpliceImpact**, a transformer‑based LLM for per‑residue functional effect prediction, optimized with PySpark & Azure ML.

### Postdoctoral Researcher, Integrative Biology & Predictive Analytics Lab, UC Davis — Davis, CA  
**Sep 2020 – July 2022**
- Built ML models for personalized diet recommendations using 5,000+ gut microbiome samples and metabolic networks.  
- Applied ML to multi‑omics studies of IBA tolerance and bat viral immunity; led grant‑funded research efforts.

### Machine Learning Consultant, Sinopia Biosciences — San Diego, CA  
**Oct 2019 – Jan 2020**
- Preprocessed & batch‑corrected drug‑response metabolomics data (1,000+ samples).  
- Developed ML models to identify metabolic signatures of drug action.

### Graduate Student Researcher, Systems Biology Research Group, UC San Diego — San Diego, CA  
**Sep 2015 – Sep 2020**
- Published 4 first‑author & 10 co‑author papers (900+ citations); featured by UCSD press & F1000.  
- Built pangenome of 1,595 pathogens; trained SVMs to predict drug resistance, discovering 33 known & 24 novel genes.  
- Pioneered a hybrid FBA–ML framework matching SOTA performance and improving interpretability for anti‑TB drug mutations.  
- Applied ICA & statistical modeling to link E. coli adaptive mutations to transcriptomic & flux constraints; identified multiple regulatory strategies and mutation correlates.
